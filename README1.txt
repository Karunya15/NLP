PROJECT : Predicting  if a customer's review is good or bad (Polarity)

INTRODUCTION : 

1.Given, two datasets : train_csv and test_csv
2. To predict whether the customer's review is good or bad. 
3. The train data has three feature columns: 
     UserID: unique ID of the customer
     ReviewText: description of the review posted
     Polarity: target Variable
4.Polarity is the target variable with a shape of (16750 rows and 3 columns)
5.Test dataset has 2 columns UserId and ReviewText with 8250 rows.

INSTALL:

This project requires Python and the following Python libraries installed:
NumPy
Pandas
matplotlib
scikit-learn
nltk
textblob
regular expression
seaborn

CODE:

Coding is done in jupyter notebook 
1. Predicting  if a customer's review is good or bad (Polarity)
We will need train.csv and test.csv files to work  and complete the project.

Steps followed:
1.importing of necessary libraries
2.loading the datasets
3.analysing the target variable
4.text cleaning and text preprocessing
5.lemmetizing
6.train-test splitting
7.model building 
8.performance on train data
9.accuracy check
10.performing evaluation on test data
11.predicting response for the target variable
12.submission csv file

CONCLUSION:

The program and the approach taken for completing the project is based on my knowledge and understanding.
The various methods and models used in the preogram has been checked and finalised.
